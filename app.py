    ## üöÄ How to Use This Tool
    
    1. **Upload** a clear image of your plant leaf using the sidebar
    2. **Click** the "Analyze Plant Health" button
    3. **Get** instant disease detection and treatment recommendations
    
    ### üì± Tips for Best Results
    - Use good lighting when taking photos
    - Focus on leaves that show clear symptoms
    - Ensure the leaf fills most of the image frame
    - Avoid blurry or low-resolution images
    
    ### üåæ Supported Plants
    This tool can detect diseases in:
    - **Tomatoes** (7 different conditions)
    - **Potatoes** (3 different conditions) 
    - **Bell Peppers** (2 different conditions)
